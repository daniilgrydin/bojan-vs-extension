## **Features**  
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Tailored for Bojan files (`.bjn`, `.bojan`), with vibrant colors for:
  - Strings, numbers, dates, and paths
  - Comments (`#`, `[ ]`)
  - Keywords (`true`, `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `nan`)
  - Emojis indicating log levels:  
    - `✅` Success  
    - `❌` Error  
    - `⚠️` Warning  
    - `💬` Debug  
    - `🕸️` Info  
- **Auto-Closing Pairs:** Brackets (`{}`), parentheses (`()`), and quotes (`""`, `''`) are auto-completed to reduce typing effort.  
- **Comment Support:** 
  - Single-line comments with `#`  
  - Block comments with `[ ]`  
- **Emoji-Based Syntax Highlighting:** Makes log levels visually distinct for quicker identification.

## **Compatibility with the Bojan Python Library**  
This extension is optimized for logs generated by the [Bojan Python library](https://github.com/daniilgrydin/bojan), which produces structured log messages with:  
- Automatic caller metadata (file, line number, method, and class)  
- Log levels categorized by emojis (`✅`, `❌`, `⚠️`, `💬`, `🕸️`)  
- Hierarchical dictionary visualization using depth-based emojis like 🏰, 🌲, and 🐛  

### **Sample Bojan Log Output:**
